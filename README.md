# AnimatedTabBar
It's a Swift subclassed class of UITabBarController and makes tabbar titles hide and bring titles up for 2 sec when any of them tapped.

This way there is plenty of room for showing larger & cleaner tabBar icons...

Usage:

Just copy AnimatedTabBarController.swift file to your project and on the Storyboard subclass your tabBar controller class from it.
